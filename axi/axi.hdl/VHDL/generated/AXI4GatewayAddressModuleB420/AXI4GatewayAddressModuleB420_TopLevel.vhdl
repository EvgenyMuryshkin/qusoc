-- * Generated code is your property, do whatever you want with it
-- * Place custom code between [BEGIN USER ***] and [END USER ***].
-- * CAUTION: All code outside of [USER] scope is subject to regeneration.
-- * Bad things happen sometimes in developer's life,
--   it is recommended to use source control management software (e.g. git, bzr etc) to keep your custom code safe'n'sound.
-- * Internal structure of code is subject to change.
--   You can use some of signals in custom code, but most likely they will not exist in future (e.g. will get shorter or gone completely)
